## 🎬 Overview

**Tropical Homecoming Dream** is a short visual story created using AI video generation tools, designed to evoke ancestral memory, softness, and sensory immersion. Inspired by the flora and light of Kwa-Zulu-Natal, South Africa — particularly the *Ficus natalensis* and banana groves in the area — this project uses only music and images to tell its story. No narration. No dialogue.

## 🪷 Inspiration

This project was born from a memory — the slow joy of returning home, barefoot, sun-drenched, and quiet.
